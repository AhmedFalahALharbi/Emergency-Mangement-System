In today's world, responding to emergencies effectively is crucial for the safety of individuals and communities.
Current emergency reporting systems often have issues with speed, organization, and data security.
To address these problems, our project aims to develop a user-friendly Emergency Reports Management System (ERMS).
This system will make it quick and easy for people to report emergencies, centralize the information for better organization,
ensure smooth communication, and keep the data secure.
By doing so, we intend to improve emergency response in various situations.
